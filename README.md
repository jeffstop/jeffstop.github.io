# Python Projects
Below are some of my Python Projects. The rest can be found here: [Python Projects](https://github.com/jeffstop/Python_Projects). These projects use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.
* [Django Checkbook](https://github.com/jeffstop/Python_Projects/tree/main/Django_Checkbook)
* [File Transfer](https://github.com/jeffstop/Python_Projects/tree/main/File%20Transfer)
* [Nice or Mean](https://github.com/jeffstop/Python_Projects/tree/main/Nice%20or%20Mean)
### Django Checkbook
This program utilizes the Django framework to create a checkbook to keep track of the transactions of an account. Accounts and transactions can be created by users and are added to the database.
### File Transfer
This program uses tkinter to create a gui that allows a user to transfer files created/modified in the last 24 hours from a folder to a different folder of their choosing.
### Nice or Mean
This is a simple python game. Players answer a question by being nice or mean, the game then responds to that answer(nice or mean), keeps track of how many times the player has been nice or mean, and once a player has been nice three times or mean three times the game ends with an option to restart. This game demonstrates how to pass variables from function to funciton.
